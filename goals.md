Data Visualization - SVA-DSI
========

# LEARNING GOALS

## KNOWLEDGE
* [x] understanding the design process
* [x] types of prototypes and when to use them
* [x] career options
* [x] where to find resources

Each class will address aspects of the design process building toward a series of prototype visualizations and finally a capstone project. The bibliography features complimentary resources to the weekly readings and practice links/exercises, and we'll round out the semester with internships and work opportunities.

## SKILLS
* [x] critical thinking (analysis, argumentation)
* [x] problem framing
* [x] systems thinking and mapping
* [x] research and insight development
* [x] evaluation: measurement and indicators
* [x] design (thinking)
* [x] critique
* [x] prototyping/making
* [x] storytelling and presentations

All courses will exercise student's capacities to think critically about project design, conduct preliminary testing and research to ensure that the design direction is sound, and finally build prototypes that evolve the story they've designed around their chosen datasets. Thereafter, they'll practice presenting their work, promoting it, and testing it with communities.

## ATTITUDES
* [x] Resourceful
* [x] Self-directed
* [x] Creative
* [x] Curious
